AIM: Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease Progression using Longitudinal Clinical & Neuroimaging Data

Prerequisite Skills: Programming language (python tools & libraries), Machine Learning, Deep Learning

Project Type: Research Paper

Objectives: 
To develop a machine learning-based approach for classifying Alzheimer's disease progression using longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging data, with the aim of aiding early diagnosis and treatment planning.
To classify the 7 different stages of Alzheimer’s disease using various machine learning techniques (like SVM, random forest).
Using machine learning tools & techniques to enhance the quality & productivity of medicine & healthcare centers related to Alzheimer’s disease.
To examine the abnormalities in brain structure with the help of an MRI scan & detecting Alzheimer's disease in the early stages. 

Conclusion:
Identify the most prescribed drugs for the patient suffering from Alzheimer’s disease in mild, moderate & severe cases.
The proposed model should be effective, easy to deploy, time-saving & cost-efficient.
Find out that the patient is at which stage of Alzheimer’s disease. 
Suggesting the best treatment option & recommending the specialist in the field for further consultation.
